# Instagram-Bruteforce
first instagram-bruteforcer in a GUI, coded in vb.net
an executable version is included for those who don't know how to compile code or just don't have visual studio.
as of right now, it can bruteforce any instagram account, however it requires a wordlist, and gets banned from trying to log in after 1,000 failed attempts. 
I am currently working on making it bruteforce properly without a wordlist, but it will be a while before i release it, since i have to multithread this first.
